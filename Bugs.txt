1. service-missing is not working as expected. Needs to be tested to see what happens 
when a server is ungracefully removed. May need to change logic from removing services
to removing servers.

2. Need to add client config file for jerbil to avoid having readable files everywhere.

jerbil -V reports the number of times a service has been accessed through the local server.
Would be good to share all counts across all servers somehow?

If you run jerbil -v on a remote server it appears to remove a service but the removal fails.
This is because it tries to remove the service locally. Also, if a server disappears then
the other servers still think the service is available. They need to remove the service manually if
that is the case!

Fixed in 0.1.0

Would be good to hide the key check in a private function: check_key(key) rather than
expose the underlying mechanism

Also change key to pkey for private key parameters
