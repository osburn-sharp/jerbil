# This file should be used with the jerbil service init script to set
# basic options used to start the service. The service itself is configured
# by the conf_file and the default setting for this is usually OK

# NO_DAEMON can be set true to prevent the service from daemonizing and run it
# in the foreground instead. Only recommended for testing and diagnostics
#NO_DAEMON=false

# NO_SYSLOG can be set true to prevent the logger from logging messages to syslog
# Only recommended for testing
#NO_SYSLOG=false

# CONF_FILE can be used to start the service with a configuration from a file
# other than the system default (/etc/jermine/<service>.rb).
#CONF_FILE=

# LOG_DAEMON can be used to log the output of the daemon to a jelly log file
#LOG_DAEMON=false

# By default, the service will suppress all messages to the terminal. For testing and
# diagnostics, set VERBOSE to be true and run with NO_DAEMON
#VERBOSE=false

# A service name can be defined here, but in its absence, will be taken from the file name
# Which is probably not going to be right if the file has the usual "d" on the end!
