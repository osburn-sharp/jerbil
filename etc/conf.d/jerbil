# This file sets the defaults for all Jerbil services so changes to the settings
# below will affect all services unless they are overridden by values in a specific
# config file. See the Jerbil README for more details

# NO_DAEMON can be set true to prevent the service from daemonizing and run it
# in the foreground instead. Only recommended for testing and diagnostics
#NO_DAEMON=false

# NO_SYSLOG can be set true to prevent the logger from logging messages to syslog
# Only recommended for testing
#NO_SYSLOG=false

# CONF_FILE can be used to start the service with a configuration from a file
# other than the system default (/etc/jerbil/<service>.rb).
#CONF_FILE=

# LOG_DAEMON can be used to log the output of the daemon to a jellog log file
# which is useful for debugging purposes
LOG_DAEMON=true

# By default, the service will suppress all messages to the terminal. For testing and
# diagnostics, set VERBOSE to be true and run with NO_DAEMON
#VERBOSE=false

# By default, runscript will only pass /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, and /bin in the path variable
# so if your gems are getting stuffed into something else (/usr/local) then make sure
# this is set below (make sure it has a trailing /):
SBIN_PATH=/usr/local/sbin/


# define the user under which this service will run
SERVICE_USER="jerbil"

# add any services that this service uses
rc_use="logger net"

# Add further services that this service needs, remembering the d on the end!
rc_need="jerbild"
